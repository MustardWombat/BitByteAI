ADVANCED CREATE ML WORKFLOW FOR STUDY EFFICIENCY
===============================================

1. DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY
--------------------------
- Track study sessions with:
  * Start/end timestamps
  * Task type (reading, problem solving, memorization, etc.)
  * Difficulty rating (1-5)
  * Completion percentage
  * Self-rated focus/quality (1-5)
  * Time of day, day of week
  * Context (location, noise level, etc.)

2. MODEL DESIGN STRATEGY
----------------------
- Primary Models:
  * Time Predictor: When to study (tabular regression)
  * Duration Predictor: How long to study (tabular regression)
  * Task Recommender: What to study next (classification)

3. FEATURE ENGINEERING IDEAS
--------------------------
- Time-based features:
  * Hours since last study session
  * Day segment (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
  * Days from deadline

- Performance features:
  * Moving average of recent completion rates
  * Task difficulty progression
  * Energy level patterns
