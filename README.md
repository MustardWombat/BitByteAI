4. Querying

‚Ä¢ Use NSPredicate to filter records.
‚Ä¢ Use CKQueryOperation for more advanced queries or large result sets.

‚∏ª

5. Sync and Notifications

‚Ä¢ Use CKSubscription to get notified of changes.
‚Ä¢ Use background fetch or silent push notifications to sync data.

‚∏ª

6. Sharing

‚Ä¢ Use CKShare and the shared database to enable user-to-user sharing.

‚∏ª

7. Error Handling

‚Ä¢ CloudKit operations are asynchronous and may fail due to network or permission issues.
‚Ä¢ Always handle errors by checking the error parameter in completion blocks.
‚Ä¢ For certain errors (like rate limiting), CloudKit will suggest a retry-after time.

‚∏ª

8. Security and Privacy

‚Ä¢ User data in the private database is encrypted and only accessible by the user.
‚Ä¢ Public data is readable by all users, but writable only by your app.

‚∏ª

9. Example Use Case: Syncing Tasks

Storing a Task:
‚Ä¢ Create a CKRecord with fields like title, dueDate, etc.
‚Ä¢ Save to the private database.

Fetching Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Use a CKQuery to retrieve current user‚Äôs tasks.

Reacting to Changes:
‚Ä¢ Set up a CKQuerySubscription to watch for changes and update your UI.
